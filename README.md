This repository contains additional information and tips on the Potassco [benchmarktool][btool],
primarily focused on things directly related to our research group.
It will not include an extensive guide on how to use the tool. That can be found in the
benchmark tools [documentation][bdoc].

An older guide to the benchmark tool can be found in the `legacy/` folder. This guide is based on
an outdated version of the benchmark tool, but may still be helpful in some cases.
